# Welcome

This is the code and research portfolio of **Michael Kenteris**, Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of the Aegean.

## Featured Projects

### [ScholarGraph](ScholarGraph/) - Research Knowledge Graph with GraphRAG

A GraphRAG system that gives Claude Code persistent memory of research literature.

- 51-paper scoping review corpus indexed
- Neo4j knowledge graph with semantic search
- MCP server integration with Claude Code
- Local-first, privacy-preserving architecture

### [CEFR Validation Tool](teacherassessment/) - Educational Standards Validation

A triangulated validation framework for CEFR descriptors using keyword analysis, LLM ensembles, and expert review.

- Discovered 7.3% true misclassification rate
- Web-based expert review interface
- Multi-method validation approach
- Implications for LLM-grounded educational systems

### [FL-KG-LLM Scoping Review](fl-kg-llm-scoping-review/)

Systematic review of Federated Learning, Knowledge Graphs, and Large Language Models convergence in language education.

- Identifies critical research gaps
- Proposes neurosymbolic framework
- CEFR-aligned pedagogical grounding

## Recent Writing

### [SmolLM2: A Data-Centric Alternative for Pedagogically-Grounded Language Model Validation](/blog/2025/12/28/smollm2-pedagogical-validation/)

Why a 1.7B model trained on educational data outperforms generic alternatives for language learning validation—without sacrificing transparency, deployability, or privacy.

### [CEFR Validation: How I Discovered 25% of Educational Standards Were Misclassified](/blog/2025/12/26/cefr-validation-triangulation/)

Using keyword analysis, LLM ensembles, and expert review to validate CEFR descriptor classifications.

### [Giving AI Memory: A GraphRAG Approach](/blog/2025/12/25/giving-ai-memory/)

How I gave Claude Code a permanent, structured memory using GraphRAG and MCP.

> "By giving my AI a memory system, I've moved from 'searching for information' to 'synthesizing insights.'"

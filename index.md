## Recent Writing

### [SmolLM2: A Data-Centric Alternative for Pedagogically-Grounded Language Model Validation](/blog/2025/12/28/smollm2-pedagogical-validation/)

Why a 1.7B model trained on educational data outperforms generic alternatives for language learning validation—without sacrificing transparency, deployability, or privacy.

### [CEFR Validation: How I Discovered 25% of Educational Standards Were Misclassified](/blog/2025/12/26/cefr-validation-triangulation/)

Using keyword analysis, LLM ensembles, and expert review to validate CEFR descriptor classifications.

### [Giving AI Memory: A GraphRAG Approach](/blog/2025/12/25/giving-ai-memory/)

How I gave Claude Code a permanent, structured memory using GraphRAG and MCP.

> "By giving my AI a memory system, I've moved from 'searching for information' to 'synthesizing insights.'"
